        <h3>My contribution</h3>
        <p>I&apos;ve learned that it can be really challenging to translate designs pixel-perfect, and that just following Figma spacings and sizes for some reason doesn&apos;t translate to that 1:1 implementation.</p>
        <p>I&apos;ll be an eager learner open to learn how you work, and make sure to keep up with the latest of CSS possibilities.</p>
        <p>I&apos;ll put a lot of effort into making sure we&apos;re doing accessible implementations now that the EU accessibility act is in action.</p>
